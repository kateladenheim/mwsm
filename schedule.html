                        Dance & Robotics Workshop: Designing Bodies to Dance</button>

                        <p>How do we make a robot crawl like a centipede, buzz like a bee, wiggle like an octopus, or walk like a human?  This workshop will pose a possible direction toward such ends.  First, we will move together.  This will activate an innate ability to imitate each other and, in doing so, illuminate the principal components of Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies -- a field comprised of Laban Movement Analysis and Bartenieff Fundamentals -- and the Body, Effort, Shape, Space, and Time (BESST) System of movement analysis.  Next, we will try to write down what we’re doing.  A set of symbols for describing elements of the BESST System, which seem to be perceptually meaningful to human observers, will be presented so that movement can be notated and, thus, translated between bodies.  We will explore both Labanotation and “motif”-style notation for movement on both natural and artificial bodies to understand platform dependence and invariance.  Finally, we will envision future bodies, which might crawl, buzz, wiggle, or walk.  Simple mock-ups of artificial bodies will be created in hopes that they may enact the ideas from our movement scores.  Spoiler alert:  it doesn’t matter if they ever do; the point of the exercise is to learn about ourselves. </p>

                        <p>Join us for a presentation on the collaborative performance and research project <em>COMMIT!</em>. This gallery exhibit transforms data collected during <em>COMMIT!</em> performances, in which a performer falls repeatedly, throwing themself on the ground trying to execute the most “committed” fall that they possibly can. During the show, “commitment” is measured by gathering qualitative data (real-time responses on perceived commitment from the audience) and quantitative data (collected via sensors that track the shape of the performer’s body, its estimated speed, and force and pattern of impact). Project collaborators will discuss their process of creating the performance and the resulting artifacts built from collected data, and reveal a new generative animation tool.</p>

                        Keynote: Bodies Dancing in Unison</button>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p class="ledby">Featuring Amy LaViers</p>
                        <p>Can a human imitate an octopus?  Can a bee mimic a centipede?  Can a quadruped mirror a biped?  When do two bodies in motion do the same thing?  Moving robots out of factories requires that we consider the ability of a body’s movement to communicate, express, or otherwise encode meaning.  This new context poignantly demonstrates how the arts are an essential body of knowledge for robotic research: Musicians make instruments like a cello and flute perform similar actions, bolstered by shared notation.  Likewise, dancers take disparate bodies, people with differing bone structures and musculatures, and create coordinated group action in a novel motion style that serves a single expressive goal.  The talk will grapple with the impossibility of dancing in unison and posit this phenomenon as a fundamental act that forms the basis of embodied communication.  The talk also highlights possibilities and challenges posed by movement notation for robotics, drawing parallels to the development of modern music notation, by presenting work by artist-engineer teams in the RAD Lab:  robots that imitate human movement; a teleoperation scheme driven by movement notation; a metric for measuring the expressiveness of a moving body; new systems for notating movement; and a twenty-foot-wide breath-activated public robotic art installation inspired by bird wings that gives participants immediate creative experience with robots.</p>

                        <p>In this workshop, participants will devise individualized "Process Maps" through collective feedback about their creative ideas. Nothing will be off the table. Mapping ideas is a method of organizing ideas into actionable tasks that can be achieved through various forms including - the body, sound, visuals, text, and scent. These maps are a reflection of the creators' values on the specific project and offer a pathway of setting goals and being a score simultaneously. Participants will construct their maps on paper and should retain them for future use.</p>

Advances in AI motion capture are making it even simpler for people to express themselves through embodied motion, and reproduce that motion in digital and virtual worlds. This workshop will focus on how to use this technology to build connections between how it feels to perform motion and how that motion can be translated into dynamic immersive experiences.</p>

                        <p><em>SALT</em> is an excerpt from a current work-in-development collaboration between interdisciplinary choreographer André M. Zachery and interdisciplinary sound/media artist Sadah Espii Proctor entitled "Against Gravity: Flying Afrikans and Other Urban Legends." This section is named and inspired by a novel of the same name by Trinidadian writer Earl Lovelace, the tale of “Igbo Landing” and the legend of “the people who could fly”. The relationship between “the water” and “flight” is symbiotic and at times reciprocal in African Diaspora cultural landscapes. This excerpt contends with how we are moving the speculative, unseen and yet to be heard towards the center of our trajectory while collectively engaging in futuring practices.</p>
