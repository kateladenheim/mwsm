                        <p>How do we make a robot crawl like a centipede, buzz like a bee, wiggle like an octopus, or walk like a human?  This workshop will pose a possible direction toward such ends.  First, we will move together.  This will activate an innate ability to imitate each other and, in doing so, illuminate the principal components of Laban/Bartenieff Movement Studies -- a field comprised of Laban Movement Analysis and Bartenieff Fundamentals -- and the Body, Effort, Shape, Space, and Time (BESST) System of movement analysis.  Next, we will try to write down what we’re doing.  A set of symbols for describing elements of the BESST System, which seem to be perceptually meaningful to human observers, will be presented so that movement can be notated and, thus, translated between bodies.  We will explore both Labanotation and “motif”-style notation for movement on both natural and artificial bodies to understand platform dependence and invariance.  Finally, we will envision future bodies, which might crawl, buzz, wiggle, or walk.  Simple mock-ups of artificial bodies will be created in hopes that they may enact the ideas from our movement scores.  Spoiler alert:  it doesn’t matter if they ever do; the point of the exercise is to learn about ourselves. </p>

                        <p>Join us for a presentation on the collaborative performance and research project <em>COMMIT!</em>. This gallery exhibit transforms data collected during <em>COMMIT!</em> performances, in which a performer falls repeatedly, throwing themself on the ground trying to execute the most “committed” fall that they possibly can. During the show, “commitment” is measured by gathering qualitative data (real-time responses on perceived commitment from the audience) and quantitative data (collected via sensors that track the shape of the performer’s body, its estimated speed, and force and pattern of impact). Project collaborators will discuss their process of creating the performance and the resulting artifacts built from collected data, and reveal a new generative animation tool.</p>

                        Keynote: Bodies Dancing in Unison</button>
                    <div class="description">

                        <p>Can a human imitate an octopus?  Can a bee mimic a centipede?  Can a quadruped mirror a biped?  When do two bodies in motion do the same thing?  Moving robots out of factories requires that we consider the ability of a body’s movement to communicate, express, or otherwise encode meaning.  This new context poignantly demonstrates how the arts are an essential body of knowledge for robotic research: Musicians make instruments like a cello and flute perform similar actions, bolstered by shared notation.  Likewise, dancers take disparate bodies, people with differing bone structures and musculatures, and create coordinated group action in a novel motion style that serves a single expressive goal.  The talk will grapple with the impossibility of dancing in unison and posit this phenomenon as a fundamental act that forms the basis of embodied communication.  The talk also highlights possibilities and challenges posed by movement notation for robotics, drawing parallels to the development of modern music notation, by presenting work by artist-engineer teams in the RAD Lab:  robots that imitate human movement; a teleoperation scheme driven by movement notation; a metric for measuring the expressiveness of a moving body; new systems for notating movement; and a twenty-foot-wide breath-activated public robotic art installation inspired by bird wings that gives participants immediate creative experience with robots.</p>
